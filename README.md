# snyk-cli-greybeard

Want to make your security findings feel more "real"? We're excited to announce the official public release of Snyk CLI Greybeard edition! Unlike the normal Snyk CLI which will help you find security issues in your code, containers, dependencies, and IaC, this special "Greybeard" edition of the CLI will give you the same information, but with much more personality.

Snyk Greybeard is experienced, knowledgeable, and tired of your security ignorance. Greybeard has a more sarcastic, dry, and endearing grumpiness that transforms your boring security scans into a heated roast, with lots of fun commentary to brighten your day.
